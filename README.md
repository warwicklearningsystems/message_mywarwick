# MyWarwick message output

A message output plugin for Moodle that sends notifications to the MyWarwick app 'alerts'.

## Installation ##

The plugin should be installed in the 'message/outputs' directory under 'mywarwick'.

## Configuration ##

System-wide the plugin requires the alerts URL and authentication details to be populated before any messages can
be sent.

By default no users receive notifications through this message output - this must be configured either by individual
users (in Notification preferences) and/or by altering the default message output options.
